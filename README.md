# Debugging Practice Repo

In this repo, students are asked to debug broken toy problem solutions in increasing difficulty. Ideally, they will be taking the code in these repos and putting them into a debugging tool. A recommended implementation is chrome snippets + chrome dev tools. 

## Step1
Step1 is intended as a warmup, or for an instructor to use to demonstrate how to use devtools.

## Step2
Step2 is especially helpful in showcasing how to set up breakpoints, how to watch for variables and how to read information from dev tools. 

## Step3
Step 3 is more difficult, and is intended for students to do on their own.
